step 6: 
Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header 
elements that are direct children of a card class.  
The required styling is the following:

20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.

/* 
step 7: 
Edit the css for the card class to match our example. 
Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.  
You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that 
flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  
You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width.

Edit the css for the pricing class to match our example. 
You should use flex and the cards should be centered both horizontally and vertically. */
